The score is applied separately to each password.

for score below fib_i:
        - the level reached is    i
        - the lock time is        fib_i
        - the fee per hour is     1 / fib_i

Rules:
    - correct input of the password gives score +1
    - during the [lock time] no score points can be lost or achieved
    - after the [lock time] each hour that passes decreases the score by [fee]
